    <h1>Energy </h1>
    <p><a link href="google.com" >The capacity for doing work. It may exist in potential, kinetic, thermal, electrical, chemical, nuclear, or other various forms. </a><br> are, moreover, heat and work—i.e., energy in the process of transfer from one body to another. After it has been transferred, energy is always designated according to its nature. Hence, heat transferred may become thermal energy, while work done may manifest itself in the form of mechanical energy.

        All forms of energy are associated with motion. For example, any given body has kinetic energy if it is in motion. A tensioned device such as a bow or spring, though at rest, has the potential for creating motion; it contains potential energy because of its configuration. Similarly, nuclear energy is potential energy because it results from the configuration of subatomic particles in the nucleus of an atom.</p>
<h1> Alfred Brandt</h1>
<p><a link href="google.com" > Alfred Brandt, (born September 3, 1846, Hamburg [Germany]—died November 29, 1899, Brig, Switzerland)</a><br> German civil engineer who was primarily responsible for the successful driving of the Simplon Tunnel, one of the largest of the great Alpine tunnels.
    As a young railroad engineer in the 1870s, Brandt observed the difficulties of the construction of the St. Gotthard Tunnel (Italy-Switzerland) and was struck by the possibility of improving the drilling-blasting sequence by employing a hydraulic rather than a pneumatic drill. He designed a machine that was tried out in the next Alpine railroad tunnel built, the Arlberg (Austria-Switzerland), and it proved a great success. Commissioned to drive the 20-km (12.5-mile) Simplon Tunnel (Italy-Switzerland), Brandt produced a novel plan to combat the 
    high temperatures resulting from the tunnel depth—two galleries (separate tunnel headings parallel to each other), connected by crosshatches, providing ventilation 
    and a circuit for supply and debris-removal trains. The new tunnelling technique proved brilliantly successful, but Brandt, working almost 24 hours a day, succumbed to strain and died a little more than a year after the work commenced.
